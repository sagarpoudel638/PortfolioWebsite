			As we are in 21st century many things have changed in past few years. Technology have also evolved along with humans.
			We are attached with technology as it has became our one of the fundamental needs. 
			We are stuck to technologies from morning yawn to night yawn. Lets take example of a normal person, 
			he/she wakes up with an <u>alarm</u>, goes to kitchen and burn <u>gas</u> to cook something, eats
			breakfast and watches morning news on <u>mobile</u> or <u>T.V</u>.
			He/She goes to office with help of <u>transporation vehicles</u> and work on <u>computer</u>, returns home with help <u>transportation</u>, eats dinner and sleep putting <u>alarm</u>. 
			We didn't have to go far , I am writing this blog on laptop putting my headphones on my ear. 
			Directly or indirectly techonolgy have made an impact on our daily lives. 
			As everything has pros and cons. This attachment of technology also have similar amount of pros and cons.
			<a  name="advantage"></a>Lets, discuss about both good and bad things related to use of techology in our daily life.

					Technology contributes poistive impact on society. If there was no evolution of technology then who knows 
					we might have living life of stone age era. Many things are changed by help of technology. It was a 
					dream to fly everyone in past thought a person is fool if he/she talks about flying but nowadays 
					its common to travel east-west and north-south and this is only possible due to technology. 
					This thing has made us able to talk with person of any place within seconds.<br>

						Technology have played vital role in health sector. As we remember between 1347 and 1351 black
						death occured in europe and wipeout half popoulation of europe if this started to occur in today's
						generation it have been cured in initial age because diagonisis of diseases are made easier with the 
						help of technology. By the help of technology , doctors and researchers are able to find cure of deadly
						diseases. We can fight with many health related problems with the help of technology.

							Similary,Education system have also changed due to imapct of technology. People can learn many things from internet.
							There are online courses that can help a person to gain knowledge in any field.Today students are able to learn about their subject 
							Students show more attention due to technology and its effective to teach by using technology. For example, if students are taught geography
							<a  name="disadvantage"></a>using google maps and earth then they will remember more than teaching by books.

					Technology have same amount of negative impact on life that its have positive. Technology have made people sluggish, many 
					people prefer taking vehicles on short distance instead of going by foot.In earlier days, people like to meet in certain places but nowadays social 
					networks have overtaken us and texting in social platform in more prefered than meeting.We rarely see children playing after school because nowadays they like to 
					play videogames and stream television instead of playing other outdoor games. There was a day when parents had to scold thier
					children to come home but nowadays they are scolding to go and play outside.<br>

						<p style="cursor:default;margin-top:2px;margin-left:50px;font-family:Arial;font-size:20px;margin-right:20px">
						Technology have fully overtaken our brain. We are so dependent to technology that we can't even think without help of 
						technology.As already discussed we directly or indirectly use technology all day( morning bed to night bed).
						This have covered our brain completely. Our pace in technology may be danger to mankind. As we know there are so many devasting weapons
						made by technological brain which can kill huge number of people within blink of eye.

							In earlier days, after dinner parents and children used to talk about their whole day. They used to share 
							many things to one another but nowadays not even after dinner in dinner too they pretend like they are not there, 
							by keeping them busy in smartphones or televisions. Technology is making distant people near and near people distant.
							There was a day when all family used to laugh at same joke but in present day they laugh but jokes are different , time is different and 
							<a  name="conclusion"></a>emotion is different.

						At last, its clear that all have advantages and disadvantages. Its depend on us that how we behave ,how we use, how we see such things.
						Technology have effected our health by creating pollution and in other hand it is saving it by discovery of vaccines of deadly 
						diseases. We have to use technology wisely so that it be beneficial to us.
